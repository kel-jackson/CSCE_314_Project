# CSCE_314_Project
This is a project written in JavaScript for a Programming Languages course. This project takes in text files with caption data for a video and stores the words found with the word's count in a Red-Black Tree. This structure can then be used to compare the captions for different websites to determine how many words are the same or different and the differences in word counts.
